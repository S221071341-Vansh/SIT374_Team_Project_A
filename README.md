# SIT374: Team Project-A - AppAttack

Welcome to my SIT374 Team Project-A Github repository for the AppAttack project. This is a collaborative project driven by students undertaking this unit and led by Vansh Khanna in a co-leadership role as a Junior at Hardhat Enterprises Company.

This repository serves as a centralized location for Vansh Khanna to store and manage his own project-related files, code, and documentation for the university assignment, as well as technical contributions to the team project at an individual level. It also allows anyone to track the project's member progress and collaborate effectively after asking for permissions.

## Project Aim

This unit's primary aim is to utilize the knowledge and skills gained from Portswigger and TryHackMe.com upskilling websites in a real-world setting. The project then, focuses on conducting software testing on the "OnTrack" website, with the aim of identifying vulnerabilities, correcting them, modifying the code, and generating a report highlighting the application's issues to improve website security. The ultimate goal is for the student to apply their upskilling expertise, collaborate with a team, and acquire essential skills by proactively identifying and resolving vulnerabilities while also boosting the website's overall security.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AppAttack project, the first step is to clone the "Ontrack" repository onto a local machine and set up a development environment using a Kali Linux virtual machine (VM). This project's setup folder provides a detailed instruction list on how to set up the base and testing environment in Kali Linux VM, which will be used for testing purposes.

After setting up the 'Base Environment' as Kali in VM, the next step is to clone the "doubtfire-deploy" repository onto the local machine and set up the testing environment, while enabling some extensions for smooth usage while testing, which can be seen under 'Extensions' folder. Detailed instructions are also available in the same place under the setup folder. Once the setup process is done, the it involves deploying the code onto a server, which will be used to generate one's own findings that would need to be addressed by developing solutions and making necessary code changes.

Throughout the process, tools like Burpsuite will be utilized as primary tool to provide assistance.
